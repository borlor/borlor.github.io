Today while doing an Excel course the course required us to use the following formula

The formula was asking us to perform some look up on the tables using VLOOKUP. After working with it for a while it felt a bit too clunky and long, so I used another variation which was much shorter like so

I think that if you are going to use a lot of VLOOKUP it generally helps to shorten, it might not be logically correct, but it is much easier to read and work with in a multi-step data query.
